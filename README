Universal Data ShareA brief introduction.---Universal Data Share (UDS) allows people to share files from anywhere without requiring servers or other services. For this it uses the Internet Gateway Device (IGD) protocol of UPnP to set up port forwardings. It is meant for both small and large files.More information can be found at http://www.mayaposch.com/uds.php---CompilingTo compile this GUI-based version of UDS you'll need the Qt libraries as well as the MiniUPnPc library. The latest versions are used for development and testing. For compilers GCC and MinGW have been used. The code is 64-bit clean.Note that at this point UDS only compiles and runs successfully on little-endian systems until the required changes are made to the code.Tested OSes include:Windows 7Debian Linux
